##Lore

The village maintains a deeply ingrained tradition of communal intimacy within the sauna, a central ritual interwoven with their culture and daily life. Within this space, the usual boundaries of privacy are softened to prioritize the collective needs of the community. The sauna serves not only as a place for physical release but also as a social hub where emotions, desires, and connections are openly acknowledged and celebrated. The atmosphere is often lively and festive. A raised platform serves as the focal point for the ritual act, where intimacy becomes a communal experience, observed by the other villagers. Midwives are always present to offer guidance and ensure pleasure for both participants. A medallion system ensures fairness and chance in the selection of partners, with each girl having an equal opportunity. The medallions represent a woman's participation and contribution to the village's well-being, and a man's responsibility for respectful interaction. The heat of the sauna is believed to act as a form of contraception, providing psychological reassurance, though this belief lacks scientific basis. The ritual strongly emphasizes mutual pleasure and achieving orgasm, encouraging both partners to embrace their desires and express their pleasure openly. Pregnancies are rare but occur despite the precautions and are seen as a blessing from the god of fire. Children born from these unions are raised communally, further strengthening the bonds within the village.


### Chapter: The Heat of the Sauna


Laila stood at the sauna's edge, wearing nothing but the medallion her mother had given her. The warmth of the steam enveloped her as she stepped inside, her breath catching in her throat. The air was thick with the scent of herbs and the faint tang of sweat, clinging to her skin like a damp cloth. She had heard stories of this place, of the rituals that took place here, but nothing could have prepared her for the reality of it.

The sauna was surprisingly small, barely large enough to hold two dozen people. Wide, worn wooden benches lined the walls, packed with bodies – men on one side, women on the other. The steam blurred the lines between them, creating a hazy, dreamlike effect.

Her gaze was immediately drawn to the center of the room, to the raised wooden platform. It stood tall, reaching just above her shoulders height, with three shallow steps leading up to it. Even from here, she could see the smooth, polished surface gleaming wetly under the dim light.

As she entered, a naked man was helping a young woman carefully descend the steps. They were both flushed and damp, their faces wearing expressions Laila couldn't quite decipher – a mix of relief, embarrassment, and perhaps satisfaction. A midwife in wet white robe, her face stern and focused, wiped the platform with a thick towel as soon as they stepped away, preparing it for the next couple.

Seeing Laila, she descended quickly, her eyes kind and welcoming, approached Laila, gesturing towards the women's side of the room. "Welcome, Laila, I was expecting you," she said, her voice soft and reassuring. "It's a big step you're taking. Just breathe. If you feel ready to offer yourself, place your medallion face down in the pot. It takes courage. Do it only if you're truly ready to face whatever fate the gods decide."

The midwife gently guided Laila toward the pot on the woman's side of the room. It was already holding a handful of other medallions. As she looked around, Laila saw several of the other girls nodding at her with encouraging smiles, their eyes filled with a mixture of camaraderie and anticipation. A warmth spread through her, a shared understanding that helped quell the fear tightening in her chest.

Laila’s eyes darted towards the men's side of the room, a wave of anxiety washing over her. *Any one of them could be chosen for me,* she thought, her heart pounding in her chest. What if it was one of the older men, their faces lined with age and their bodies weathered by years of labor? Or someone she found unattractive, with a gruff manner and calloused hands? The thought made her skin crawl.

She took a deep breath and looked down at the medallion in her hand. It was more than just a piece of metal; it was a symbol of her entry into womanhood, a representation of her willingness to embrace the traditions of her village. With a hesitant movement, she carefully placed her medallion face down in the pot, pushing it gently among the others.

Freya, a girl with freckles across her nose, shifted on the bench to make room, her rounded belly showing she was six months pregnant. The bench was wide, letting girls sit with their legs stretched out, crossed, or tucked under them. 'Here, Laila,' she whispered, offering a small smile. Another, slightly older girl, Tania, with intricate braids leaned in. "Deep breaths, we all were on your place," she comforted her. Elara asked, "What did you feel when you put down your medallion?" She didn't wait for Laila to answer, instead sharing her own experience, "I couldn't do it when I first came here... I just ran away! It takes some courage...". Tania, decided to change topic, "How is your sister? Still behaving?" The question about her younger sister, so mundane, grounded Laila for a moment, a small anchor in the swirling steam and tension. She managed a weak nod. The girls around her shared looks of understanding.

Her mother had prepared her for this ritual, explaining the intricacies and expectations, yet Laila couldn't shake off the nervousness that had taken up residence in her stomach. Before she could dwell on her fears, a man stood up and walked to the pot. He reached in and pulled out a medallion, his eyes scanning the room.

A hushed silence fell. Laila recognized him – Todd, a farmer from the outskirts of the village. He was a large man, his face weathered, and his beard thick with red hair. She'd never seen him in the sauna before. A wave of murmurs swept through the girls. "Todd?" "Oh, gods, who's it going to be?" "He looks...rough." Laila's heart pounded as she overheard them. What if he would take her medallion? There is a chance, this is not how she dreamed it would be.

Todd read the name inscribed on the medallion, "Elara". Elara stood up, a sigh escaping her lips as she frowned. The other girls exchanged understanding glances as Todd approached her. In this moment, social status and appearance meant nothing - everyone had an equal chance before the gods. Laila saw her take a small, involuntary step back as Todd approached.

Hesitantly, she reached out and let him place it around her neck. He smiled, but Elara didn't meet his gaze.

The midwife, sensing her hesitation, moved closer, a stern-faced woman with a booming voice, scolded gently. "This is a gift. Honor the gods' choice, not the man who gives it."

Elara's shoulders sagged, and she turned away from Todd, walking to the platform with a mix of reluctance and resignation. She leaned forward, resting her elbows on the wooden surface, and presented her back to him, signaling her desire to distance herself from him.

The girls whispered among themselves, their voices barely audible, "Elara had her heart set on Elian, the smith's son. She saw him in her dream today!"

Todd's eyes locked onto Elara, uncertainty flashing across his face. He climbed onto the platform, positioning himself behind her, his brow furrowed in concern. But just as Todd was about to proceed, he hesitated. He wiped the sweat from his forehead. Elara's face tensed, anticipating intrusion, but instead, she flinched in surprise as Todd gently reached for Elara's shoulders, his touch surprisingly tender. He kneaded her tense muscles, whispering something in her ear that Laila couldn't quite catch. Elara's eyes met Todd's, her expression neutral, but she gave a slight nod and widened her stance, opening herself up to him. The midwife let out a sigh of relief.

Laila's feelings were torn, pitying Elara for being matched with a man she didn't desire, while also feeling a pang of discomfort towards Todd, who was met with Elara's obvious disdain.

A sharp intake of breath escaped Elara as his thick body connected with hers, her eyes closing as she tries to focus on the sensations. Laila's view was limited from where she sat, the platform towering above her, blocking most of what was happening between Elara and Todd. She watched as the man started moving, slowly at first, but soon, the air was filled with the rhythmic sounds of their bodies moving together. Laila's thoughts drifted, picturing herself in Elara's position, wondering what it would feel like, as she watched Elara's face for any signs of pain or pleasure. She thought about the possibility of being paired with an older man, like the one on the platform. It was a fate decided by the gods, and she couldn't change it if it happened. She glanced around the room, seeing that others were watching as well, their faces filled with a mix of desire and anticipation.

She had never seen such raw intimacy between a man and a woman. As Todd's movements gained rhythm against Elara's back, a novel warmth bloomed between her legs, a delicate stirring that demanded her notice. The sounds of their bodies moving together, the soft gasps escaping Elara's lips, painted a vivid picture in Laila's mind, a picture that resonated in a newly awakened part of her. Warmth collected deep within her, a languid tide that reached the sensitive folds, making them feel strangely heavy and alive. Caught in the heat and the moment, her hand strayed downwards, a hesitant touch seeking the source of the strange new feelings.

His movements grew stronger, and Elara's hand slipped down, helping herself, her body moving in sync with his, their rhythms merging as one. Suddenly, the girl’s breath came in shallow gasps as her body tensed, her form shuddering faintly. For a moment, Elara's face relaxed into a faint smile, suggesting to Laila that she felt pleasure, not pain. Then Todd groaned loudly, his body shuddering as he leaned in close to the girl's back. For a moment, they stayed still, connected, the girl's chest rising and falling with each breath. A girl whispered softly to comfort Laila, "Don't worry, the heat won't let his seed take root." Laila saw how the girl gently pressed her fingers to her abdomen, after he left her body, then they exchanged quiet smiles before stepping down from the platform.


Elara approached the bench, a hand subtly pressed between her thighs. The girls immediately turned to her, curious.

"Elara, are you alright? What was it like with Todd?"

Elara grimaced slightly. "He tried to be gentle, but he was entering too deep at first. I only really adjusted to the sensation by the end, but by then, he was already coming."

The midwife, having wiped the platform clean, approached with a fresh cloth. "Elara, are you staying to offer your medallion again?" she asked. Elara confirming with a nod, took the cloth, wiping herself.

Laila, still reeling scene on the platform, looked at Freya who was pregnant. Freya noticed Laila's gaze and touched her belly. "Are you afraid of conceiving, Laila?"

Laila nodded hesitantly, looking down at Freya's round belly.

Freya smiled reassuringly. "Don't worry. I'm sure the child is from my husband. I only returned to the sauna just recently, after he was recruited."

The midwife patted Laila's shoulder. "The steam will keep you safe, child. Don't worry about pregnancy. Besides," she added with a wink, "hot seed opens your bloom and nourishes your womb."

Freya nodded in agreement. "My sister didn't visit the sauna often, and she ended up having a very painful labor."

The midwife nodded solemnly. "And that's why Freya is here," she said, gesturing to Freya's swollen belly. "We need men to keep her passage open for smooth labors while her husband is away."


A moment later, next man, medallion in hand, and called out, "Tania!"

Tania stood up with a smile, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. A younger man, Greg, walked towards her, his youthful face framed by slightly wild, dark hair. As he placed the medallion around her neck, he deliberately brushed his erection against her belly. Tania giggled, a playful sound that hinted at her confidence.

As Tania mounted the platform, she took charge, guiding Greg to sit down. She then straddled his legs and began to massage his shoulders, whispering something in his ear that made him lean back with closed eyes and a content smile.
Laila watched, captivated, as Tania knelt to face Greg, her hands disappearing into his lap. A moment later, Tania rose and straddled Greg’s lap. His moans were audible even from where Laila sat. Tania was a whirlwind of motion, her hips grinding against Greg's, driving him wild, and she rode Greg through his orgasm until she came herself.

When Tania returned, her cheeks were flushed, and she was beaming with happiness. "Well, that was invigorating!" she exclaimed. "But I've got to go. Greg's semen is far too prone to escape. If I don't run now, it will all drip away!"

As Tania left, a ripple of giggles ran through the group of girls. "Sounds like Greg puts himself under pressure too often," one of them whispered, a mischievous glint in her eyes.


The midwife wiped the platform's stairs, below the spot where Elara had just stood, and called out the next pairing. Laila's eyes followed another man as he approached the pot. He scanned the room, his gaze sweeping across the faces, before reaching in and pulling out a medallion. As he read the name inscribed on it, Laila's heart skipped a beat. Her eyes widened in awe - the name was hers.

The boy scanned the room, searching for the girl whose name was on the medallion. "Woaa! You are lucky to have him being your first!" Girls nudged her playfully, trying to ease her tension, Laila slowly stood up, her hands hovering over her blossom shyly. Elian's familiar face was chiseled, his features strong and handsome as he walked towards her with a confident stride. His eyes locked onto hers with hint of surprise, and a small smile played on his lips, "Laila? I didn't know you came to the age...". His physique was chiseled from years of working at the forge, and as Laila's gaze drifted downward, she couldn't help but notice his eagerness.

Laila’s pulse quickened, she felt a mix of excitement and fear and just nodded in response awkwardly. He was three years older than her, with strong arms and a gentle face. He held out the medallion, and she saw her name etched onto its surface before he placed it around her neck. The medallion's cool metal settled between her breasts, a gentle chill against her skin.

Elian smiled reassuringly, taking her hand and helping her onto the platform. The wood, polished smooth by years of use, felt cool beneath her as she lay down. The platform stood higher than the crowd, hiding her lower body from view and offering a bit of privacy. As she looked down, Laila saw familiar faces from her village, their eyes filled with a mix of curiosity and encouragement.

The midwife was nearby, offering words of guidance and reassurance, she helped Laila into half-seating position, leaning against a wooden railings, reminding her to relax and breathe deeply. Laila felt his hand on her knee, gently encouraging her to spread her legs. She hesitated for a moment, feeling a bit shy, but the Elian's touch was gentle and reassuring.

"Open a little wider, dear, nothing to be ashamed of", the heat prickled her skin as she cautiously obeyed the midwife's guidance. A strange flutter tickled her belly, a mix of nervousness and something akin to curiosity. What will it feel like? Her muscles trembled slightly as she widened her stance.

She felt his gaze, his fingers trailed down her inner thigh, stopping just before her sensitive folds. She could sense his eagerness, her eyelids fluttered shut, unable to bear the sight of what was happening. The midwife reminded her to focus on her breath, to let go of any tension.

The midwife gently guided Laila, helping her to adjust her position.  "Now, child," she said softly, "Elian is here for you.  He offers himself to you. Take a moment to know him."

He leaned forward to her, pressing his warmth against her belly, almost reaching her navel. The firm heat of him, pressing against her sensitive skin, a tangible presence, a promise of the intimacy to come, stretching just above the very core of her being, like tracing the path it was about to take inside her. She smelled the faint herbal scent of the sauna's bathing water clinging to his skin. Elian gently took her hand, guiding her hand down her own belly, his gaze meeting hers with a gentle encouragement. Her fingers trembled as they brushed against the velvet smoothness of his arousal. Tentatively, she closed her hand around him, the unfamiliar shape and pulsing heat igniting a cascade of new sensations within her. Deep within her, unfamiliar muscles clenched instinctively, a subtle flexing, trying to embrace the nascent yearning, the emptiness that instinctively yearned to be filled with... him.

Before she could do more, the midwife gently stopped her. "Enough, child.  Time to lie down now. The gods have chosen this moment." She urged Laila to lie back on the platform, adjusting her position to be more comfortable.

Their bodies touched, her heart skipped a beat as he slowly pressed himself in. This was it. Laila felt a sharp sting as her body gave way to him, and she gasped, overwhelmed. Elian pressed himself in, deeper and deeper, slowly letting her get used to the feeling of fullness.

As they became fully joined, the pressure inside her was unlike anything she had ever felt before. She was nailed to the wooden platform by him, his presence a solid, undeniable anchor. The midwife stepped forward, a wreath of flowers in her hand, pulling Laila out from this intense connection. The midwife placed the wreath on Laila's head, starting her pronouncement. The words washed over Laila, a distant buzzing in the periphery. "She is a woman now," the midwife began, but Laila barely registered the sounds. The people below were a blurred, indistinct mass, nothing more than a backdrop to the profound reality of Elian inside her. He, too, seemed suspended in the moment, a subtle tension in his frame hinting at a restrained urge to move.

The midwife continued her speech, "...men offer their seed and women offer their vessels..." the cadence rising and falling, but Laila's focus remained solely on the sensation of Elian within her. Suddenly, she felt him flex deeply, a deliberate internal movement that sent a shiver through her. She glanced up and saw a playful smile tugging at the corner of his lips. A wave of realization washed over her – he was teasing her, intentionally stirring the nascent desires blooming within her through their intimate connection. It felt as though his very body was whispering secrets directly to her womb, a private conversation amidst the droning pronouncements of the midwife.

The midwife's speech came to an end, her voice ringing out as she declared, "She is ready now." With a warm smile, she nodded to Elian, her eyes crinkling at the corners.

Finally, he began to move, his body swaying gently as he slid into her, the warmth of the sauna enveloping them like a cocoon. The midwife's soothing voice whispered in her ear, "Close your eyes, child, and focus on the sensation. Let go of your thoughts and allow your body to guide you."

She obeyed, her eyelids fluttering shut as she concentrated on the feelings coursing through her. The heat in her abdomen grew, a slow-burning fire that seemed to spread throughout her being. Each time he slid in, she felt a soft, unfamiliar brush just below where they joined. An unusual sensation that built up inside her like a gathering storm. The deliberate pace of his movements was almost hypnotic, drawing her into a world of pure sensation.

As he danced inside, the friction between them created a spark that ignited a deep-seated passion within her. His rhythm fractured—a stutter, a gasp—and for a moment, his weight sagged against her. Her eyes flew open in surprise, and she gazed up at him in awe and curiosity. She started feeling a pulsation deep inside her, a rhythmic throbbing that seemed to match the beat of her own heart. 

The muscular smith, with his strong arms and broad shoulders, looked vulnerable for a moment, his eyes closed and his face contorted in a mixture of pleasure and release. For a moment, the intimacy of the act felt tender, a shared vulnerability that made her heart beat faster. His body stilled within her, a gentle tremor passing through him. A warmth bloomed deep in Laila's belly, a sensation both new and overwhelming. She instinctively tightened around him, a reflex born of instinct and a nascent desire to prolong the connection.

The midwife's voice brought her back, "Hold still, child, his fire ... fills you, don't be scared." But Laila didn't listen, she focused on the feeling of him inside her, the weight, the warmth, the subtle rhythmic throbbing.

A thought crossed her mind, fleeting but unmistakable - it wouldn't be so bad to bear children from this handsome boy. The idea sent a shiver down her spine, a mix of fear and excitement that left her breathless. But for now, she pushed the thought aside, focusing on the sensations that still lingered within her. She could feel his muscles relaxing, his breathing slowing. He was still deep inside her, a silent, comforting presence. 

He opened his eyes, a touch of apology in them. "I... I'm sorry," he stammered, pulling back slightly. "I didn't mean to be so quick. It was... too good." Laila searched for the right words, puzzled by his apology. She nodded hesitantly, a shy smile on her face. The midwife stepped forward, smiling kindly. "You both did fine, children. Elian, you were gentle, and Laila, you were brave."

She found the courage to look down, her gaze following as his softening length slipped out of her. He helped her sit up, his gentle hands guiding her as he spoke in a low, husky voice, "Welcome to adulthood, Laila." She couldn't help but reach down, instinctively, assessing the changes of her body. Her fingers came away sticky and stained crimson, proof of a passage, just as her mother had described. *I am a woman*, she thought.

The midwife approached, her hand gently resting on Laila's arm, guiding her forward. A fond smile played on the midwife's lips. "Let his fire nourish you before washing it clean, don't let it escape," she murmured. "That warmth is meant for you, dear. Keep our sacred space pure."

Laila's heart was racing as she only then realized the warm liquid spreading between her thighs, the midwife's words drawing her attention to the intimate exchange that had just occurred. She pressed her fingers between her thighs, holding in the warm liquid. As she stepped down, her leg brushed against the step, and Elian's hand closed around hers, supporting her. She felt a mix of confusion and anticipation as she stood, her legs shaky beneath her. The wetness and emptiness between her legs reminded her of what had just happened, and she knew she was a woman now. "Thank you," he whispered. "You were brave," guiding her to the exit. "Was I?" Laila asked, unsure.

As they reached the door, Elian opened it for her. She instinctively stepped through, expecting him to follow, a shared smile and the warmth of their recent intimacy lingering in her. But Elian lingered at the threshold, his gaze dropping to the floor. "I... I need to stay and cool down," he mumbled, avoiding her eyes. Then, with a quick nod, he turned back into the sauna room, the door swinging shut behind him, leaving Laila standing alone in the cool air.

The abrupt separation sent a shiver through her, the lingering warmth of the sauna suddenly feeling like a distant memory. A pang of loneliness echoed in her chest. She was a woman now, yes, but a woman standing alone.

She stepped into the open-air bathhouse, the natural hot springs swirling with steam. People milled about, wrapped in towels or already submerged in the various pools carved from natural stone. Children splashed and laughed, their naked bodies glistening in the light, creating a vibrant, almost carefree atmosphere that felt jarringly out of sync with the turmoil in her heart. Her wreath, a symbol of her newfound womanhood, suddenly felt heavy on her head.

As she hesitantly walked toward her parents, many of the bathers nodded to her with respect, acknowledging her passage. Laila lowered her gaze, self-conscious under their scrutiny.

Her parents stood near one of the pools, wrapped in thick bathing towels. The worry lines etched on her father's face seemed deeper than before.

"Laila," her mother said, her voice soft with concern. "Are you alright, dear? Did it go well?"

"Yes, Mother," Laila replied, though the words felt hollow. "It... it was alright."

Her mother quickly wrapped a soft white linen cloak around Laila's naked body. At the same time, Laila's hand involuntarily relaxed, allowing the warm liquid to escape from between her legs.

Her father's gaze was fixed on her legs, his expression unreadable. He was silent for a beat too long. Then, his eyes widened slightly, a look of horrified understanding dawning on his face. His gaze had followed a slow drip that escaped down her inner thigh, staining the smooth stone a faint, milky white.

"You promised, Martha!" he hissed, his voice a low tremor of panic. "You promised this rite was safe! That it wouldn't bring children before marriage!"

Her mother's hand tightened on his arm, a warning glint in her eyes. "Thomas, please. This isn't the time."

"But look at her, Martha! Look at her! She's... filled with his... seed!" The word hung in the air, heavy with disgust. "What if she bears his child now?"

Laila's face flushed crimson. She hated when her father spoke like that, his words sharp and demeaning. The casual acceptance she had seen within the sauna felt far away, now replaced with this harsh judgement.

Her mother's grip tightened on his arm. "Thomas, enough. She's just come through this. Don't fill her head with fears." She turned to Laila, her voice soft but firm. "Who did the gods choose to be your first, dear?"

Laila hesitated, glancing at her father. "Elian," she mumbled.

Thomas's face darkened. "Elian, you say? The smith's son? He's barely more than a boy himself!"

"She's a woman, Thomas, not a child," her mother retorted. "And Elian is a good man. Remember, I spent many nights in that room," gesturing toward the sauna door "and yet I never conceived until I met you!"

Laila bristled. "It's alright, Father," she said, her voice rising slightly. "The steam keeps it from taking root, anyway. That's what the older girls say, those who go to the sauna regularly."

Her father stared at her, a mixture of disbelief and frustration in his eyes. "The steam? Laila, daughter... that's just...superstition."

Her mother sighed. "Let it be, Thomas. She needs our support now, not your anxieties." She squeezed Laila's hand. "Come, dear. Let's get you cleaned up."

Her sister stepped forward, her eyes wide. “Laila, what was it like?"

Laila hesitated. "It was... confusing. A lot to take in."

"Was it scary?" her sister asked.

"Yes," Laila admitted. "But… Elian was kind."

Her mother nodded, understanding in her eyes. “It's a passage, dear. Laila is a woman now."

She was no longer just a girl; she was a woman, a part of the community. She stood up, clean and renewed. This experience will be with her always, a reminder of her strength and her place in the world.
